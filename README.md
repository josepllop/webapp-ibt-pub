## Aditional information:
To create the framework for the app we used NUX.

To get the bottons we used DaysiUI

For the database we used Appwrite for convinience.

For hosting we used CloudFlare for easier integration (no payed hosting needed)

The app works only in google chrome because CloudFlare is not integrated with Safari,
we would need to buy a hosting to see it in different browsers.
